  <h2>About James</h2>
<p>
  My name is James Brofos. I am a statistician and machine learning engineer. I studied mathematics and computer science at <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a>, where I graduated with a B.A. in 2015. I am interested in Bayesian nonparametrics, deep neural with a probabilistic component, and graphical models.
</p>
<p>
  I now work at <a href="http://www.mitre.org">The MITRE Corporation</a>. We operate federally-funded research and development centers. We assist the United States government with scientific research and analysis, development and acquisition, and systems engineering. My work allows me to leverage machine learning and statistics to benefit the public interest.

  This is Thor Server, the online component of the Thor software library for Bayesian optimization. This site is intended to allow you to easily keep track of your experiments regarding parameter optimization of machine learning algorithms!
